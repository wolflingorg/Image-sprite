# Task

The `images` directory contains two types of images: **photos** (prefix `ph_`, various width) and **posters** (prefix `poster_`, width: `200px`)

Create a `sprite.jpg` image (width: `200px`, example `./sprite.jpg`) with all images from directory `images` (minimizing to poster’s size) following one under another.

#### Please ensure that:

 - You do not use any existing composer solutions
 - You do not re-minimize posters (since they are already minimized)
 - You follow SOLID principles
 - You do not overuse `else` or `switch/case` operators
