# Task

The `images` directory contains two types of images: **photos** (prefix `ph_`, various width) and **posters** (prefix poster_, `width: 200px`)

Create a `sprite.jpg` image (`width: 200px`, example `./sprite.jpg`) with all images from directory `images` (minimizing to poster’s size) following one under another.

####Please ensure that:

 - you do not re-minimize posters (since they are already minimized)
 - you follow SOLID principles
 - you do not overuse `else` or `switch/case` operators
